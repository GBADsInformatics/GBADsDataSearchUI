# Home Page Documentation

## Description
This React component represents the home page of the application. It includes a search bar, navigation, and displays keyword options based on the user's search query.

## Component Functionality

### State Variables
- `searchText`: Holds the current search query entered by the user.
- `keywords`: Stores the list of keywords fetched from the API based on the user's search query.
- `showAnimation`: Controls the visibility of keyword options animation.

### Functions
- `receiveSearchFromChild`: Receives the search query from the child component (SearchBar) and updates the `searchText` state variable. It then calls `fetchKeywordsFromApi` to fetch keywords based on the search query.
- `fetchKeywordsFromApi`: Makes an asynchronous API call to fetch keywords based on the search query using Axios. Upon successful response, it updates the `keywords` state variable.
- `useEffect`: Triggers the animation when `searchText` and `keywords` are not empty.

### Render Method
The `render` method returns JSX elements representing the structure of the home page:
- `MainpageNav`: Renders the main navigation component.
- `Container`: Contains the main content of the home page.
  - `Image`: Displays the logo of the application.
  - `h2`: Heading displaying the title of the application.
  - `SearchBar`: Renders the search bar component.
- `Container` (conditional rendering): Displays keyword options only when `searchText` and `keywords` are not empty.
  - `HomeKeywordOptions`: Renders the component to display keyword options.
