# FAQ Component Documentation

## Description
This React component represents the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page of the application. It provides answers to common queries about the site's purpose, search functionality, keyword usage, data updates, and more.

## Component Functionality
The `FAQ` component displays a set of predefined questions and their corresponding answers. These questions and answers are stored in the `faqDictionary` object.

### FAQ Dictionary
The `faqDictionary` object contains key-value pairs where each key represents a question, and each value represents its corresponding answer.

### Render Method
The `render` method returns JSX elements representing the structure of the FAQ page:
- `MainpageNav`: Renders the main navigation component.
- `Container` (main content): Displays the FAQ section with questions and answers.
