# Logs Page Documentation

## Description
This React component displays logs fetched from the GBADs TAIL API. It presents the logs in a formatted manner, with alternating background colors for better readability.

## Component Functionality

### State Variables
- `logs`: Stores the logs fetched from the GBADs TAIL API.

### Functions
- `fetchLogsFromAPI`: Makes an asynchronous API call to fetch logs from the GBADs TAIL API using Axios. Upon successful response, it updates the `logs` state variable.

### Render Method
The `render` method returns JSX elements representing the structure of the logs page:
- `h1`: Heading displaying the title of the logs page.
- `hr`: Horizontal rule for visual separation.
- `div`: Container for displaying logs.
  - Conditional rendering: Checks if there are any logs fetched. If not, it displays a message with a link to make a request. If there are logs, it maps through each log, formats them, and displays them in alternating colors.
